* As a user, I should be able to save a cocktail to a "Favorites" list.
* As a user, I should be able to add notes to a saved cocktail.
* As a user, I should be able to click a box to track whether or not I have tried a cocktail.
* As a user, I should be able to delete a cocktail from my "Favorites" list. 

## Stretch Goals:

* Swipe through random cocktails without having to search for a specific cocktail.
* Allow user to customize all ingredients to create their perfect cocktail.
* Ability to upload photo of user-made cocktail.
* Mobile responsiveness.
